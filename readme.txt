With the Print Science Designer, your customers can customize print products you offer in your WooCommerce Wordpress store.

== Description ==

Use the Print Science Designer plugin to offer customizable print products from your WooCommerce website.

You can use product customization for business cards, wedding invitations, greeting cards, labels, phone cases, certificates and more. Your customers can add both text and images to the different designs you offer.

After the customer finishes the customization, you print and ship the products.

Products are PDF templates and the output is a high resolution, print ready PDF.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What can I sell using the Print Science Designer? =

Virtually anything that can be custom printed. Think of the kind of things a customer would want to personalize from a range of standard templates. The standard use is for things like business cards, greetings cards, wedding and party invites. But we also have customers who use it to let their customers create personalised beer mats, labels for soda and wine bottles used on special occasions and lawn signs for election campaigns.

= Which formats does the Designer output? = 

The final product is output as a high resolution, print ready PDF.

= Do I need to install special PDF software on my server? =

No. The Designer is an HTML5 application that runs in the user's web browser. Once your customer finishes and approves the design, the data is sent to our PDF creation servers and the final output is stored on our servers. You will then be able to access the PDF from a link in your WooCommerce dashboard.

The Print Science Designer uses none of your server resources to create or store the PDF so you won't have to upgrade your own hosting.

= Does the Designer plugin require WooCommerce?  =

Yes. You must have WooCommerce installed.

= Can I use the Designer plugin with a shopping cart other than WooCommerce?  =

No. The Designer plugin works only with WooCommerce at the moment. Email 
jw@printscience.com if you'd like to request other popular shopping carts.
